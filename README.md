Blaze DSP is a open source, cloud powered Demand Side Platform.

Blaze DSP has been designed with the priority on low latency, highly scalability and fault tolerance.

This focus allows for server load to be balanced effectively across instances without the loss of critical analytical data in the event of server failures.

It also allows for servers to be located in regions closest to the end use which reduces request time and improves user experience.

Each server is updated in realtime which allows campaign changes to be easily managed without interruption to the end user or loss of revenue for the business.
